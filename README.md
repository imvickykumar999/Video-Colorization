**Clone the repository; install dependencies**

```
gh repo clone imvickykumar999/Video-Colorization
pip install requirements.txt
```

**Colorize!** This script will colorize an image. The results should match the images in the `imgs_out` folder.

```
python demo_release.py -i imgs/output.jpg
```

**Model loading in Python** The following loads pretrained colorizers. See [demo_release.py](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Video-Colorization/blob/main/extras/demo_release.py) for some details on how to run the model. There are some pre and post-processing steps: convert to Lab space, resize to 256x256, colorize, and concatenate to the original full resolution, and convert to RGB.

```python
import colorizers
colorizer_eccv16 = colorizers.eccv16().eval()
colorizer_siggraph17 = colorizers.siggraph17().eval()
```

### Original implementation (Caffe branch)

https://pub.towardsai.net/colorizing-images-with-deep-learning-a34d11587643

The original implementation contained train and testing, our network and AlexNet (for representation learning tests), as well as representation learning tests. It is in Caffe and is no longer supported. Please see the [caffe](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/tree/caffe) branch for it.
